      <p id="tribute-info">Malcolm Mitchell Young (6 January 1953 â€“ 18 November 2017) was an Australian musician and
        songwriter, best known as a co-founder, rhythm guitarist, backing vocalist and songwriter for the hard rock band
        AC/DC.<br>
        Malcolm Young was 20 when he and younger brother Angus formed AC/DC in 1973. Angus was on lead
        guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on
        vocals. "Can I Sit Next To You Girl", their
        first single, was later re-recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name AC/DC after
        seeing the letters "AC/DC" on the back of their sister Margaret's sewing machine. In 1975 AC/DC had moved to
        Melbourne. <br>
        In early 1977 they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon
        Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the
        respective bands. <br>
        In 1988, Young missed the majority of AC/DC's Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address alcohol
        abuse issues. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his
        nephew, Stevie Young.
     <br>
        The following lists summarise the discography of the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. Between
        1974 and 2014 AC/DC released 17 studio albums (15 available worldwide and 2 released only in Australia). <br>

      <p id="tribute-info2"> In April 2014, Young became seriously ill and was unable to continue performing. On 16 April
        2014, AC/DC released a note stating that Young would be "taking a break from the band due to ill health.
        <br>
        In July, Brian Johnson revealed that Young was in hospital receiving treatment for an unspecified
        condition and during May recording sessions had been replaced in the studio by guitarist Stevie Young, his nephew.
        <br>
        Young died on 18 November 2017 at the age of 64, at Lulworth House in Elizabeth Bay. His funeral
        was held at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney on 28 November.
